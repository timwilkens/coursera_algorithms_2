Digraph API

  Use the same design pattern as with undirected graphs

  addEdge method only adds edge in one direction now

  New Method: reverse (digraph where all of the edges are reversed)

  Suppose that a digraph G is represented using the adjacency-list representation. What is the order of growth of the running time
    to find all vertices that point to a given vertex v?

    1. indegree(v)
    2. outdegree(v)
    3. V
**  4. V + E

    If needing to know indegree for each vertex was important, we could associate another list with each vertex
