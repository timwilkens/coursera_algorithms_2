Directed Graphs

  Similar to undirected graphs but with important differences

  Digraph - set of vertices connected pairwise by directed edges
    - edges are defined as ordered pairs (the 'is connected to' relation is no symmetric)

   'Path' and 'Cycle' have the same meaning in directed graphs
   Degree is the same, but can be further divided into 'indegree' and 'outdegree'

  Application: road network
    - vertex - intersection
    - edge - one direction of a street (allows one-way streets)

  Application: bank loans
    - vertex - bank
    - edge - loan from one bank to another

  Other applications: electrical circuits, WordNet graph, cell phone calls

  Many of the problems are similar to the ones we've seen with undirected graphs
    - are two vertices connected
    - whats the shortest path between two vertices
    - topological sort - can you draw a digraph so that all edges point upwards
    - strong connectivity - is there a directed path between all pairs of vertices
    - transitive closure - for which vertices v and w is there a path from v to w
    - PageRank - hat is the importance of a web page?

  How many different digraph are there on V vertices? Allow self-loops but do not allow parallel edges.

    1. V
    2. 2 ^ V
**  3. 2 ^ (V ^ 2)
    4. 2 ^ (2 ^ V)
