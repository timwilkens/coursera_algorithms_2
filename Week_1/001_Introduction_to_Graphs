Introduction to graphs

  Models for processing undirected graphs

  Undirected graphs - set of vertices connected pairwise by edges
  
  Why study graph algorithms?
    - thousands of practical applications
    - hundreds of graph algorithms known
    - intersting and broadly useful abstraction
    - challenging branch of computer science and discrete math

  Ex: protein-protein interaction network
    - vertices are proteins
    - edges are interactions

  Ex: internet
    - vertices are clients/servers
    - edges are connections

  Ex: - map of science clickstreams
      - 10 million facebook friends
      - one week of Enron emails
      - evolution of FCC lobbying coalitions

  Graph terminology
    - path - sequence of vertices connected by edges
    - cycle - path whose first and last vertices are the same
    
    Two vertices are connected if there is a path between them

    Connected components are subsets of a graph where every pair of vertices are connected

  Graph-processing problems
    - is there a path between s and t
    - is there a shortest path between s and t

    - is there a cycle in the graph
    - euler tour - is there a cycle that uses each edge exactly once?
    - hamilton tour - is there a cyce that uses each vertex exactly once?

    - connectivity - is there a way to connect all of the vertices?
    - mst - what is the best way to connect all of the vertices? (minimum spanning tree)
    - biconnectivity - is there a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph?

    - planarity - can you draw the graph in the plane with no crossing edges?
    - graph isomorphism - do adjacency lists represent the same graph?

    Challenge - which of these problems are easy? difficult? intractable?

  A cycle that uses each edge of a graph exactly once is called

    1. a simple cycle
**  2. an euler tour
    3. a hamilton tour
    4. a path
