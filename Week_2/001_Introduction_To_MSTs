Minimum Spanning Trees

  Given: undirected graph G with positive edge weights (connected)
  Def: a spanning tree of G is a subgraph T that is both a tree (connected and acyclic)
    and spanning (includes all of the vertices)

  Goal: find a min weight spanning tree

 Brute force: try all spanning trees - impractical

  MSTs are used to model bike routes, arrangment of nuclei, image dithering, cluster analysis

  Let G be a connected, edge-weighted graph with V vertices and E edges. How many edges are in a 
    minimum spanning tree of G?

**1. V - 1
  2. V
  3. E - 1
  4. E

  Explanation: If a subgraph had fewer than V - 1 edges, then it cannot be connected; if a subgraph has more than V - 1
    edges, it must have a cycle.
