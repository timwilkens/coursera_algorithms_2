Running Time Analysis

  Computing a mincut is easy
  Find an augmenting path: use BFS
  If FF terminates, it always computes a maxflow
  FF DOES always terminate, but the proof is tricky (and requires capacities always be integers)

  Proposition: Number of augmentatations <= value of the maxflow
  Proof: each augmentation MUST increase the flow by at least 1

  Possible Implementations
                          # of paths            implementation
    shortest path         <= 1/2 EV               queue (BFS)
   
    fattest path          <= E ln EU              priority queue
  
    random path           <= E U                 randomized queue

    DFS path              <= E U                   stack (DFS)

        digraph with V vertices, E edges, and integer capacities (max U)

  If all the edge capacities are integers, the value of the maxflow is ______.

    1. an integer
    2. a rational number
    3. a real number
    4. an imaginary number
