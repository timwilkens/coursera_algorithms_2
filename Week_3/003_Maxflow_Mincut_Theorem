Maxflow Mincut Theorem

  Def: the net flow across a cut is the sum of the flows on its edges from A to B minus the sum of the flows on its edges
    from B to A

  Flow-value lemma: Let f be any flow and let (A,B) be any cut. Then, the net flow across (A,B) equals the value of f
    - this gives us a link between a cut and flow
    - Proof by induction on the size of B
      - start with just t in B, then size of flow is just all paths going into t
      - swap any from A to B, and local equilibrium ensures the flow remains the same   

  Weak duality between flows and cuts
  
    Let f be any flow and let (A,B) be any cut. Then, the value of the flow <= the capacity of the cut

Two theorems to prove

  Augmenting path theorem - a flow f is a maxflow iff no augmenting paths
  Maxflow-mincut theorem - value of the maxflow = capacity of mincut

  Proof - The following three conditions are equivalent for any flow f:
    1. There exists a cut whose capacity equals the value of the flow f
    2. F is a maxflow
    3. There is no augmenting path with respect to f

  Computing a mincut(A,B) from maxflow f:
    - Go from source following only not full forward edges and not empty backward edges (gives you the set of vertices in A)

  Given a flow network, let f be any flow and let (A,B) be any cut. Then, the net flow across (A,B) is ____ the value of f.
