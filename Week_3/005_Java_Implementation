Java Implementation

  Flow network representation
 
    Associate a flow AND capacity for each edge (essentially a weight and a max weight)

    Need to process edge e = v->w in either direction: include e in both v and w's adjacency lists 

    Residual capacity:
      Forward edge - capacity - flow
      Backward edge - flow

    Augment flow
      - Forward edge - add delta
      - Backward edge - subtract delta

  Augmenting path in original network is equivalent to directed path in residual network
