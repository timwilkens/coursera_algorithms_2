Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

  Start with 0 flow at every edge

  Augmenting path - Find an undirected path from s to t such that: (treat edges as undirected?)
    - Can increase flow on forward edges (not full)
    - Can decrease flow on backward edge (not empty)

  Termination - All paths from s to t are blocked by either a
    - full forward edge
    - empty backward edge

  Outline:
    Start with 0 flow
    While there exists an augmenting path
      - find an augmenting path
      - compute bottleneck capacity
      - increase flow on that path by bottleneck capacity

  Questions:
    - How to compute a mincut?
    - How to find an augmenting path?
    - Does FF always terminate? If so, after how many augmentations?
